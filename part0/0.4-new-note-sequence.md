# 0.4 – New note (classic Notes page)

**Key idea:** The form submits with a normal HTTP POST to `new_note`, the server answers with a `302` redirect to `/notes`, and the browser **fully reloads** HTML/CSS/JS and then refetches JSON before re-rendering.

    Note over browser: User types note and clicks “Save”

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note (form data)
    activate server
    server-->>browser: 302 Found (Location: /exampleapp/notes)
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
    activate server
    server-->>browser: 200 OK (HTML)
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    server-->>browser: 200 OK (CSS)

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    server-->>browser: 200 OK (JavaScript)

    Note right of browser: Browser executes JS and fetches data

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    server-->>browser: 200 OK (JSON notes)

    Note right of browser: JS callback re-renders the list of notes
```
